		they can make that date or change it with the client if needed.&nbsp; If 
		the client is not on the phone, then call the therapist first and get a 
		range of open dates to choose from.&nbsp; Then call Testy Testerson

		<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">If you cannot get hold of 
		the affiliate before calling the client, call the client anyway and set

		Whereas you can lose sales if you cannot get back to the person or pin 
		down a date because of difficulties getting in touch with a therapist.</span></li>
