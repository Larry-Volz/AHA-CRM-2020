This function assumes that you are familiar with CGI scripting.

*Read the RESTRICTIONS below before using this function. As always, test
your forms before making them live.*

One of the security features built into the transaction system is the
use of a PGP signature.
Each transaction confirmation is sent to the merchant's return address
(ret_addr), signed
with a PGP signature. This is a bullet-proof security feature that gives a
merchant the knowledge that the transaction confirmation was sent by the
processing server.

You will need a PGP application installed on your server that supports
dynamic verification of an RSA signature. Follow this link for
information about using PGP with Windows, Unix, Macintosh, Perl, Java,
C++, etc.:
The International PGP Home Page <http://www.pgpi.org> (See the Products
Page)

*You may obtain the Publc Key by scrolling to the bottom of this page.*

*RESTRICTIONS*

# Transactions are only signed when either the PASSBACK or LOOKUP FUNCTION
is used.
# As with any other dynamic web page, your ret_addr (return address) must
be a CGI script or some other application, such as CFM or ASP that is
capable of parsing the name/value pairs that are passed, including the
signature.
# For security reasons, you should ALWAYS pass a unique variable to the
system using the Passback Function. This will cause the signature to
have a unique value for each transaction.

*EXAMPLE*
In this example, the following field values are used:

The ret_addr field is set to "http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/return.cgi"
The LOOKUP variables requested are /email/ and /phone/
The PASSBACK variables are /fieldname1/ and /ordernum/

This is the string that is passed to the return address.

Included are PUBLIC keys used for validating the order signature. Only
one key is required. However, both a signed and an unsigned key are
included. If you are using a publicly-available PGP such as GnuPGP, you
will most likely require the signed key. (Unsigned key) -----BEGIN PGP
