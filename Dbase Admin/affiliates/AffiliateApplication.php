//################################### TERMS AND CONDITIONS BLOCK ################################

$terms_and_conditions_block = "

If you are accepted, the following services are provided by The American Hypnosis completely free of charge to you.  
We are paid entirely by the client.
You do NOT have to sign over you clients to us or become a \"cookie-cutter therapist.\"  Your clients remain your clients.  You do therapy your way.  We are only offering more opportunities for you very much akin to granting hospital privileges (albeit a virtual one...)
If you are accepted as an affiliate, The American Hypnosis Clinic will answer calls placed to our national call center at 1-888-HYPNO-22 and provide sales services for you (and the other affiliates in your area) when the clients are calling from near you. Specifically, The American Hypnosis Clinic will assign staff that will:
 	- Answer incoming calls
- Return Calls
- Explain benefits of hypnosis for various problems
- Answer questions
- Provide prices and policies
- Close sales whenever possible 
- Collect a deposit for the first appointment and sometimes payment in full
- Schedule appointments for affiliates either through an on-line calendar or through a conference or follow-up phone call
Marketing
American Hypnosis Clinic, Inc. markets itself both as a clinic, a school and as a referral service both regionally and nationally. These marketing efforts may include Internet search engine placement strategies, magazines, newspapers, radio and television.
Scheduling
You can schedule your clients any way you like, whether it is via a calendar on your desk or online.
If necessary, our program counselors (highly trained salespeople) can call you with a client and coordinate with you by phone regarding your schedule.  However, that is slow and inefficient and doesn’t make us look very organized in the potential client\’s eyes.  Often when we rely on that system we cannot get the therapist on the phone (because he or she is with other clients) and the potential client can get frustrated and even change his or her mind.  It is a good way to lose sales to other therapists.  And to be honest, it doesn’t give the same kind of professional impression as being able to make an appointment immediately.  
A better way for us to schedule appointments for you is by having your calendar in a format that our salespeople can access easily while your potential client is on the phone.
Originally we were using a corporate intranet that we rented from www.webexone.com and had to charge people to put their schedules online with us.  However, we are putting together a new online calendar system that we will be offering free to The American Hypnosis Clinic affiliates.  We will let you know when it is available and can supply you a username and password so you can schedule your clients online and can look up your schedule 24 hours a day from any computer anywhere in the world.  Yet that information will be password protected and private.  You can schedule all your clients on our system, or just those that we supply you.  (We do reserve the right to charge a fee at a later date if computer usage becomes too high... but we will try to avoid it.)
By setting up a free user account with our intranet you will also have access to articles, frequently asked questions, a discussion board and other Intranet features. Calendar will then be available to him or her via the Internet 24 hours.

Otherwise, we suggest setting up and using the free scheduling calendars that come with a free account at www.my.Yahoo.com. If you choose to do that then you are responsible for updating your calendar regularly and we suggest using it for all your scheduling needs. We ask you to let us know about the web site link immediately if/when it is set up and send us your username and password so we can set this up for you.
Note:  we are suggesting you set up a separate account for the SOLE purpose of scheduling.  You should not give out your personal calendar or e-mail information to us or anyone else!

If you choose either of these options, you are of course responsible for putting in the times you would like to work as well as check it often for last-minute updates and new appointments. PC\'s will also e-mail you when appointments are set.  But, as you know, we are only human and it’s always good to double-check your calendar regularly.

Payment
The American Hypnosis Clinic will require a one hundred dollar (\$100) non-refundable deposit from each client in order to hold an appointment for him or her. We have found this significantly reduces the number of clients who make an appointment but fail to attend (\"no-shows\"). The American Hypnosis Clinic retains the entire amount of \$100 as part of our sales commission in the unlikely event of a client’s failure to appear.  This pays for the salespeople’s time as well as our marketing costs which are substantial.

Client will usually be charged in advance or be provided a payment form by AHC and all payments should be made to American Hypnosis Clinic directly. You need to immediately fax or mail any payments made at your office to AHC and we will pay you on the 3rd and 17th (or next business day) of each month. In the case of payment plans, AHC pays you in installments just as we receive their payments.

In that we want to maintain a great relationship with you we both need to pay in a timely manner.  In the case of an affiliate failing to do so, we reserve the right to immediately revoke  affiliate status. If collection procedures are required then the affiliate will pay all costs of collections including attorney fees, collection services fees and time lost for employees involved in collections.
If the client asks for a payment plan, we will arrange it. Please call us at 1-888-HYPNO-22 and work with our office manager. In lieu of a written payment plan, payment is always due in full at the time of the patient\'s first appointment.
We charge the client a 40% commission on the total bill.  This is how we pay for our extensive advertising and sales staff.  When a client we referred to you pays at your site then you are expected to pay The American Hypnosis Clinic 40% of all monies collected and send it to us immediately.  Whenever possible, please call us and allow us to process their credit card information or electronic check over the phone.
In the event that the client fails to attend his/her appointment(s) and thereby does not pay you as planned, then please call or e-mail us within 30 minutes of the client\\'s missed appointment time.  We will follow-up with phone calls to the client to try and verify the no-show and recover the sale. 
If it is found that any affiliate falsifies information by seeing a client, accepting payment but calling it in as a \"no-show\" then that affiliate will be immediately dropped from the American Hypnosis Clinic roster and will be liable for full damages.

Who, When and Why We Refer People
When The American Hypnosis Clinic has chosen to use more than one affiliate in a given area then The American Hypnosis Clinic has complete discretion as to whom to refer a client. Telephone program counselors may choose one affiliate over another based on the client\'s preference as to a male or female therapist, who has more experience with the given issue, who has received more referrals from us (we may alternate in order to be fair), the hypnotherapy style of available affiliates or other decision-making factors completely at our discretion.  
Our primary concern is for our clients and our reputation.  Therefore, Dr. Larry Volz pre-screens every applicant based on experience, education and philosophy and assigns each therapist a rating score of between 1 and 5 stars.  As we work with therapist’s scores will be modified based primarily upon the overall success rates and reported satisfaction of the affiliate’s clients on average.  Those with higher success rates (and correspondingly higher scores) will be referred to first. 
Keep your clients healthy and happy and we will do our best to keep them coming. 
We are researching and developing a franchise and will offer it to certain affiliates at a later date.  When those franchises become available, franchise owners will generally be given priority referrals over affiliates.  Let us know if you’d like to be on the list of those interested in future franchise opportunities.

Services You are Responsible For
Your job is to provide hypnotherapy for clients for various issues according to those you are qualified to treat and can do so legally within your state. 
You do not have to treat anything you are not completely comfortable working with or qualified to handle.  We will only refer clients to you based on your entries made in this application form.
Topics frequently referred to The American Hypnosis Clinic include but not limited to: smoking cessation, weight loss, self-esteem, stress reduction, anxiety, depression, ADD/ADHD, fibromyalgia, phobias, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, memory improvement, sports attainment, PTSD and other issues.

You are primarily being referred to as a hypnotherapist and for the purpose of helping the client with a specific goal. Our belief is that, since this is what the client is asking for, you should use hypnosis first and foremost as a treatment modality.
You can, of course, use other counseling and psychological techniques that you are qualified to use as an adjunct to hypnosis as part of the program these clients have already paid for. 
Here is one thing we want to avoid:  The clients we send you are coming to you because they (and we) believe you can help them with the specific written goal using hypnosis.  We do not want people who are going to take a \"would you like fries with that\" approach and try to jack up their profit by selling the client additional services for the specific stated goal we sent them to you for.  
If you are a massage therapist or herbalist or have another related trade then of course you may market those services to this client for other issues and goals.  But no affiliate is to sell additional products or services to the clients we refer to you FOR THE STATED GOAL without consultation and permission from The American Hypnosis Clinic. This includes herbal supplements, electronic devices, and especially things like psychic or energy healing services.
Therapist Success Rates and Rankings
Although the client ultimately has the majority of responsibility in taking care of his or health, the abilities of the therapist do weigh heavily on any client\'s outcome.  Being a good therapist is more than education or training.  It has to do with being able to achieve a good rapport with a client, understanding that client\'s needs, and having the wisdom to use the right tools at the right time.
That is why AHC does follow-up calls and/or e-mails with clients and monitors our client\'s successes and failures.  Therapists are all given an initial ranking in-house from 1 to 5 stars based on their education, experience, skills and philosophy.  This is a private ranking that is in house and is not shared with anyone including the therapist.  When a therapist shows especially good results with their clients on average their ranking goes up.  If they show poorer results on average, their rankings go down.  Professionalism in their methods of doing business also is reflected in their rankings.
The end result is that our program counselors refer to the therapists with the highest rankings first so that our clients get what we believe to be the very best care from those that we believe to be the very best providers.
Retention of Client Stewardship
All clients that we refer to you remain clients of The American Hypnosis Clinic and if, in the discretion of The American Hypnosis Clinic and the patient it is in the patients\' best interest for him/her to see a different therapist, then in signing this form you agree to relinquish all notes to The American Hypnosis Clinic to be passed (confidentially) on to another therapist.
By the way, this is not something any therapist should ever be offended over. Rapport is one of the most important factors contributing towards a client\'s success. Sometimes subconscious associations attributed towards one therapist can inhibit a client\'s success - for instance a woman who was raped by a man with a beard may not do well with a bearded male therapist. But when that client is passed along to a female therapist she may succeed easily. One of the greatest strengths of our partnership is that we occasionally pass clients back and forth for the clients\' benefit and you should never be offended when it becomes prudent to do so.

Non-compete agreement
If a client learns about you through our marketing investments and not yours, then it is only ethical that you should accept that client only through our system.  Since further referrals from that client are also fruit of our marketing investments, you will need to route referrals from those clients through us as well. 
Therapists who defraud our arrangement in this way are usually caught.  They are either dropped from our referral list immediately or, if the situation is questionable, lose points (and therefore referrals) from their ranking.
If a client needs or wants to add on an addition program (for example, a smoker also wants to lose weight) then, since it is also the fruit of our marketing efforts, you must pass that information on to The American Hypnosis Clinic and we will book the client and charge our regular rates.   We will certainly send that client to you and not another affiliate as long as the client is satisfied with your services.
You may, of course, always accept clients who learn about you directly from your own marketing efforts without involving AHC.  We are not trying to take clients away from you.  We are only trying to help.

Cooperative marketing
If you have a professional web site we do ask you tol include a link back to The American Hypnosis Clinic main web site (www.americanhypnosisclinic.com) for any clients who do not live near you. 
This link is intended to be non-competitive with your personal marketing strategy.  Instead, this link is one of many that point to www.americanhypnosisclinic.com from our network of partnerships.  This strategy is intended to help raise the search engine ranking of The American Hypnosis Clinic team web site. This means more national exposure for all of our affiliates and therefore more business for you too.

The link provided below may be cut and pasted exactly as written into your web site. The American Hypnosis Clinic reserves the right to provide a different (unobtrusive) link with similar intention at a later date.

Client Notes & Dr. Involvement 
Affiliate agrees to keep good SOAP style notes on every client and use the paperwork that is provided by The American Hypnosis Clinic.  (If you are not familiar with this style of note-taking, we suggest you visit the N.G.H. website.  It is a universally recognized style that can also help protect you in legal issues if you are ever subpoenaed).

By signing this form you are also agreeing to use the paperwork supplied by The American Hypnosis Clinic to communicate all referred patients\' progress with their physicians regularly.  This is only required (or allowed) when the patient gives you permission to do so in the paperwork we use.  

The reason we encourage you to communicate with this client for YOUR benefit: 

In the case of such issues as fibromyalgia, hypertension, drug addiction and irritable bowel syndrome - a medical referral is usually a legal necessity.

Secondly, by communicating with the physician through a simple fax - physicians see the improvements in their patients\' conditions. They consider it a well-mannered courtesy and develop respect for you as a therapist, your clinic and The American Hypnosis Clinic as a team. Because of this practice, you will find that in time more and more physicians will refer clients to all of us in the hypnosis community and therefore keep us all busier.

Audio Recordings
As an American Hypnosis Clinic affiliate we ask that you supply hypnosis reinforcement recordings to your clients whenever directive hypnosis is used. The compounding of suggestions with repeated listening will invariably increase a clients\' chance of success. You can use your own pre-made recordings, a recording of the live session or other professional hypnotherapy recording on CD or audiotape. 
We have CD’s available for purchase that you are welcome to reproduce as long as you do so with an The American Hypnosis Clinic logo on their label.

Code of Ethics
We require you to abide by the code of ethics published by the National Guild of Hypnotists. A copy may be obtained through their web site at www.NGH.net. 

Confidentiality
Everything said between you and our mutual clients is to be kept 100% confidential and shared only with The American Hypnosis Clinic team members that are involved in directly providing care to the client, the client\'s physician (with the client’s permission only) or others that are specifically designated by the client in writing. 

Staying Within Qualifications
Unless you are licensed to do so according to the laws of your state, you are not to give any medical or psychiatric advice.

Respecting Client\'s Religious Beliefs
The American Hypnosis Clinic believes that everyone has the right to their own religious beliefs and that our therapists are there to help them solve their problems within their own frame of reference. As such, we align ourselves more with the medical model and scientific methods. We will all benefit more through education and cooperation than through adversarial relationships with physicians. 
We are complimentary practitioners - not alternative.

Affiliates are not to share their religious opinions with a client unless invited to do so by the client. We believe doing so is disrespectful to the clients\' personal beliefs. Energy work such as Reiki, techniques such as Spiritual Response Therapy, spirit releasement, and past life regression are all religious-based techniques that are not to be introduced unless specifically invited by the client. However, affiliate may inquire into the client\'s religious beliefs and work within those beliefs.

Modalities such as Ericksonian hypnosis, NLP, directive hypnosis, present-life regression, autogenics, EFT, biofeedback and parts therapies are all very effective means to deal with most any problem that The American Hypnosis Clinic has ever come into contact with and are all approved.

Guarantee
Our lifetime support guarantee is part of what makes us special and it is important that you understand it because if you sign on as a team member we expect you to honor it with every client you accept for as long as you are a member.  
It is NOT a money back guarantee.
The American Hypnosis Clinic does not give refunds under any circumstances and we are very clear in our paperwork to that effect.  
Instead, our policy is to charge a fair price for a program based on the average number of sessions most people need for a given goal.  Then we agree to be available to that client for life if they need more sessions. 
For instance, most smokers succeed in hypnosis in one or two sessions and so we charge (at this writing and in the Richmond area) $495 for that program.  Some people will only come once.  Rarely, some people may come 3 times.  But on average, 2 sessions seems to be the norm and so overall you are making a very reasonable fee per session.  
This kind of guarantee is becoming a trend in our industry and we believe that it is a good one.  A benefit of this is that it can reduce a client’s fears about whether or not they can afford follow-up visits. Clients are more likely to return if they need it.  Therefore they are more likely to succeed and then tell their friends about you.
Sometimes therapists worry that a client will linger and come back again and again reducing profit.  However, it is extraordinarily rare and if it does happen then you can refer that client to another American Hypnosis Clinic therapist in your area (and be ready to help your fellow team mates in the same way).  This eliminates the attachment factor between the client and you and offers a different style or point of view thus increasing the clients’ chance of success.
Here is a very important point to remember:  If at any point you ever believe this system is either unfair to you or unprofitable, you may resign at any time.  Our goal is for you to be so happy to be working with us that we don’t need a time-delimited contract.  You can leave at any time for any reason if you aren’t happy to be a part of our team.
Realistically, in our experience clients tend to succeed in fewer sessions than we recommend and when that happens you profit in that way.  It is a matter of averages.
Our guarantee encourages you to focus on the client’s goal and use your skills in an effective and quick manner.  It is not for the kind of therapist who wants to retain a client for years without ever really helping him.

In the VERY rare instance that a client needs to be shifted to another therapist in the same area or if a person moves from one geographic location into yours, we ask you to agree to honor their Lifetime support program even if you did not profit from this individual client. This is very rare, but it provides a tremendous benefit to you in that if your clients ever move to another geographic area they know other The American Hypnosis Clinic therapists will honor your agreement to help them.  It may also occur in the reverse where you begin to work with a client and he or she shifts to another therapist.  You have been paid the full sum and have only need to do part of the work involved*.  The end result is fair for everyone and the client benefits greatly because she can be fit with the therapist who best meets her needs.  This increases her likelihood of success overall, our combined reputations and chances of future referrals.
*Sometimes, if we shift a client to a different therapist and they are only part-way through a program then we ask you to split the fees in a fair and reasonable manner.  We will help arbitrate in those instances to be fair to all parties.  We try to work together as a team to everyone’s benefit and believe in a corporate idea of karma. 

The ability to honor this guarantee anywhere in the nation is a tremendous selling point, which will help us attract clients to you. The number of paying clients we will refer to you should greatly outweigh the very rare relocated individual whose follow-up care other affiliates may provide. Being a \"team player\" in this way also increases your ranking score in our system and your likelihood of being referred future clients.  
Again:  If at any point you ever believe this system is either unfair to you or unprofitable, you may simply resign at any time.  Our goal is for you to be so happy to be working with us that we don’t need a time-delimited contract.  You can leave at any time for any reason if you aren’t happy to be a part of our team.
Release to Use Your Name and Likeness. 
Affiliate agrees to allow The American Hypnosis Clinic to use the name & likeness of your business name, logo or personal face or names of individuals named in this contract for as long as The American Hypnosis Clinic and affiliate are working together free of charge in any form The American Hypnosis Clinic deems useful. 
Waiver of Liability:  Affiliate assumes all liability for the care and therapy provided to clients that are referred by The American Hypnosis Clinic. The American Hypnosis Clinic is acting only as a referral agency and is not in any way providing care for the clients. Although salespeople are trained and expected to close the sales to the best of their ability, the American Hypnosis Clinic assumes no liability for whether or not a client books an appointment, attends the appointment or pays. 
Affiliate\'s Responsibility to Regional/National Laws: Affiliate agrees to conform to all local, regional and national laws in his or her practice of hypnotherapy. Affiliate is a free agent and not an employee of The American Hypnosis Clinic. 
Affiliate\'s Insurance: Affiliate is completely responsible for his or her own liability/malpractice insurance. The American Hypnosis Clinic recommends at least a \$1,000,000 policy per therapist. 
Waiver of Liability Against AHC:  The American Hypnosis Clinic assumes no liability for the effectiveness or safety of affiliate\'s facilities or practices and affiliate holds The American Hypnosis Clinic harmless in all possible situations. 
Terms for Termination of Agreement:  Either party may terminate this agreement at any time. Affiliate will give 30 days notice if he or she chooses to suspend services. The American Hypnosis Clinic reserves the right to require additional terms or addendums to this contract in order for affiliate to remain an affiliate. Such requests will be made in writing and with 30 days warning. 
www.AmericanHypnosisClinic.com may list affiliate\'s name and therapists\' biography along with The American Hypnosis Clinic\'s telephone and e-mail contact information in any written or broadcasted form. 


Definition of Parties
This agreement is between The American Hypnosis Clinic, Inc. (throughout referred to as \"The American Hypnosis Clinic\" or \"AHC\") and the individual listed in the contact information of this form on behalf of his or her clinic (herein referred to as \"you\" or \"affiliate\"). This is the complete agreement between these parties and no other agreement is enacted or implied unless placed in writing and signed by both parties.

	  In order for us to consistantly persuade potential clients  to go ahead and book an appointment, we need to be able to schedule it right then and there.  So, to schedule clients for you we have to either have your calendar accessible to us in an electronic format (such as Yahoo or hotmail calendar), or we need to be able to schedule an appointment without having to call you first.  <br />
	  You may specify a particular day/time of the week below that you will usually be free.  Or, if you don not want to supply us with access to an online calendar for you - we can schedule an appointment at a random date approximately 3 weeks out.  Then we will contact you by e-mail.  <br />
	  If you are not available at the appointment time then it is your responsibility to contact us to reschedule the appointment for a time that will work for you.<br />
	  If you would like to use an online calendar they are free and there are some great advantages.  For one thing, you can access it from anywhere you happen to be as long as you have a computer with an internet connection nearby. Secondly, we can schedule appointments for you without worries about accidental conflicts.  And finally, others can schedule appointments for you as well when you are not in the office.  You can sign up for a free calendar at www.yahoo.com or www.hotmail.com.  You may want to have a seperate calendar just for appointments so that you can share your username and password with us and keep your personal calendar seperate.  Eventually we hope to have a calendar system integrated into our corporate intranet that will automatically generate e-mail reminders, etc.  We will notify you when that service is available.
